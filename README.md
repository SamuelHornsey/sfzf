# sfzf ðŸ“¸

## Introduction

If you're constantly taking screenshots of errors, terrible code and passive aggressive emails, this is the tool for you! `sfzf` allows you to index, search and tag your system screenshots easily though the cli. Next time someone asks you about an error you've seen before simply `sfzf 'some stupid error string'` to find all matching screenshots, allowing you to brag to your coworkers that you successfully created this error before them.

## Installation

```sh
# well i haven't written it yet...
```

## Usage

```sh
sfzf index

sfzf search "some search phrase"
```
